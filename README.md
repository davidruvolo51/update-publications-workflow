# Update Publications Workflow

This project demonstrations how to create a GitHub Action that updates a publication list using the Pubmed API. This approach uses a few custom methods (see `R/pubmed.R`) for running pubmed queries. Data is saved in the `data` folder. The github workflow is scheduled to run *tbd*. All changes are returned as a pull request.

## The Workflow
